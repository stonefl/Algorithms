/**
 *  The {@code ResizingArrayQueue} class represents a first-in-first-out (FIFO)
 *  queue of generic items.
 *  It supports the usual <em>enqueue</em> and <em>dequeue</em>
 *  operations, along with methods for peeking at the first item,
 *  testing if the queue is empty, and iterating through
 *  the items in FIFO order.
 *  <p>
 *  This implementation uses a resizing array, which double the underlying array
 *  when it is full and halves the underlying array when it is one-quarter full.
 *  The <em>enqueue</em> and <em>dequeue</em> operations take constant amortized time.
 *  The <em>size</em>, <em>peek</em>, and <em>is-empty</em> operations takes
 *  constant time in the worst case. 
 *  <p>
 *  For additional documentation, see <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/13stacks">Section 1.3</a> of
 *  <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
